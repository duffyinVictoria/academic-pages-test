My research is in graph theory and combinatorics, with a focus on colouring, homomorphisms, and structural properties of directed, signed, and edge-coloured graphs. 
Much of my work is concerned with understanding how classical notions from graph theory, such as chromatic number, transitivity, and clique structure, behave when extended to settings where edges carry additional structure, such as directions, signs, or colours.
A recurring theme is the use of homomorphisms as a unifying framework for both structural and algorithmic questions. 
I study how local constraints on orientation or colouring influence global behaviour.
This includes work on oriented graphs, mixed graphs, and edge-coloured graphs, where familiar invariants often exhibit more subtle behaviour than in the undirected case. I am also interested in switching operations and symmetry in coloured graphs, including group-based switching and its role in equivalence, extremal constructions, and Ramsey-type problems. 

A significant part of my research involves collaboration with students, and many projects originate in undergraduate and honours research. I value problems that are structurally rich, technically precise, and accessible at multiple levels of mathematical maturity.
