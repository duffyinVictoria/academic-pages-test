**Welcome**
I am a Senior Lecturer in the School of Mathematics and Statistics at the University of Melbourne.
As part of my role, I currently sit as the Director for Undergraduate Studies in the School of Mathematics and Statistics and as the Assistant Dean (Global Engagement) in the Faculty of Science. 
My main area of research is homomorphisms and colourings on graphs, oriented graphs and edge-coloured graphs. 
Though from time to time I get pulled in to other areas, such as discrete-time processes and education policy and practice.
This website can be counted to being out of date by no more than a year at any given time.
Updates usually take places in January of each year.
